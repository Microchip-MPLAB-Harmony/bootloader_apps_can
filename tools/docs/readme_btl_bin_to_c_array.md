### Path of the tool in bootloader repository is **tools/btl_bin_to_c_array.py**

## Setting up the Host PC

- The Script is compatible with **Python 3.x** and higher

## Description

- This script should be used to convert the binary file to a C style array containing Hex output that can be directly included in target application code

- It is mainly used when programming the application using the host_app_nvm application in CAN Bootloader
- If size of the input binary file is not aligned to device erase boundary it appends 0xFF to the binary to make it aligned and then generates the Hex output
