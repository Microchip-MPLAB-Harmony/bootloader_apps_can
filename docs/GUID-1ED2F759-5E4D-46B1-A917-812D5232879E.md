## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github,go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/bootloader_apps_can) and then click Clone button to clone this repo or download as zip file. This content can also be download using content manager by following [these instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki)

### Path of the NVM host applications within the repository are

-   **apps/can\_bootloader/**

-   **apps/can\_fail\_safe\_bootloader/**


## Generating Hex Image pattern used by NVM Host application

### Follow below steps only when existing test\_app is rebuilt or any other application is to be bootloaded

1.  Open the application project to be bootloaded in the IDE

    -   If existing test application has to be built open test\_app/firmware/\*.X

2.  Build the application project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

3.  Convert the generated binary \(.bin file\) to a header file containing the image data in a C style array:

    -   On a Windows machine, open the command prompt and launch the **btl\_bin\_to\_c\_array.py** utility to generate a header file containing the image data in an array

        ```
        python <harmony3_path>/bootloader/tools/btl_bin_to_c_array.py -b <binary_file> -o <hex_file> -d <device>
        ```

    -   Refer to [btl\_bin\_to\_c\_array utility](GUID-AA3E00A3-26EF-40CA-8811-8E1D00F4C227.md) for converting the binary to C array in hex format

        ![bin_to_c_array](GUID-E53F2EF5-1C8B-4B68-BEF3-FF4835216ABA-low.png)

4.  Add the application hex header file generated in above step to the test app images path of the CAN embedded host application **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/**

    -   **Example:**

        -   If the application hex header file generated is for **sam\_c21n\_xpro.X** project, Name it as **image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_c21n\_xpro.h** and place it in above path


## Configuring the NVM Host application

### Follow below steps only when Host development kit is different than Target Development Kit

1.  Open the host\_app\_nvm/firmware/\*.X project in MPLABX IDE

2.  Open the "user.h" file as shown below:

    ![can_bootloader_host_app_nvm_user_ide](GUID-E0DAAFA5-0BCA-4373-99CE-EA5A02C3D005-low.png)

3.  In the "user.h" file specify the Bootloader Target Device used using the predefined macros<br />\#define APP\_CAN\_BOOTLOADER\_TARGET\_DEVICE SAM\_C21N\_XPRO

    ![can_bootloader_host_app_nvm_user_config](GUID-6900D78A-B828-4183-ABB8-49E66A7863D5-low.png)

4.  Navigate to the **\#if block** for the specified **Bootloader Target Device** and verify the below settings are as expected.

    -   **APP\_HEX\_HEADER\_FILE:** Relative path to the generated header file containing the application hex image in an array

    -   **APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR:** User application start address \(This value should be same as the application start address specified in Application Configurations steps\).

        -   If the bootloader itself is being upgraded then the APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR must be set to:

            -   0x00 for SAM devices \(start of bootloader\)

            -   0x9d000000 for PIC32MK and PIC32MZ devices \(start of program flash memory\)

        -   Ensure that the bootloader and application are also configured with the same value of user application start address
