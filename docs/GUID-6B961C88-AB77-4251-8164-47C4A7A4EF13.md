## Setting up [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320113)

-   [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320113) is used for both **Host Development kit** and **Target Development kit**

    ![can_bootloader_host_target_connection](GUID-985E0786-75B2-4B99-8CD0-022FD5F5010F-low.png)

-   Connect the CANL on CAN Header \(J804\) of the **Host development kit** to the CANL on CAN Header \(J804\) of the **Target development kit**

-   Connect the CANH on CAN Header \(J804\) of the **Host development kit** to the CANH on CAN Header \(J804\) of the **Target development kit**

-   Connect a ground wire between the Host development kit and Target development kit

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the Host development kit to the computer using a micro USB cable

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the Target development kit to the computer using a micro USB cable


## Building and Configuring CAN Host Applications

### Using CAN NVM Host application to send the application binary to Target development kit

![host_app_nvm_setup](GUID-2CBE5220-8AAC-4B79-82D0-4AA6292D6B5E-low.png)

If the NVM Host Development Kit being used is other than [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320113) then follow the steps mentioned in [Configuring NVM Host application project](GUID-1ED2F759-5E4D-46B1-A917-812D5232879E.md#)

1.  Open the NVM host application project *host\_app\_nvm/firmware/sam\_e70\_xult.X* in the IDE

    -   If a NVM host application project of different development kit is used then open that project in the IDE

2.  Build and program the NVM host application using the IDE on to the Host development kit

    -   The prebuilt test application image available under **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_e70\_xult.h** will be programmed on to the Target development kit with default **host\_app\_nvm** project configuration

3.  Jump to [Running The Application](#running-the-application)


#### MCAN Message RAM configuration

-   Allocate MCAN Message RAM configuration in contiguous non-cacheable buffer in the NVM host application.<br />For example, static uint8\_t CACHE\_ALIGN **attribute**\(\(space\(data\), section \(".ram\_nocache"\)\)\) mcan1MessageRAM;

-   Add non-cacheable section "ram\_nocache" in the Custom linker script **apps/can\_bootloader/host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/config/sam\_e70\_xult/ATSAME70Q21B.ld**

-   Please refer [How to Create Non-Cacheable Memory Region on CortexM7 \(SAM S70/ E70/ V70/ V71\) MCUs Using MPLAB Harmony v3](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How_to_Create_Non-Cacheabl_%20Memory_Region_on_Cortex-M7_(SAME70)_MCU_Using_MPLAB_Harmonyv3_DS90003260A.pdf) to create a non-cacheable memory region.


## Running the Application

1.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/sam\_e70\_xult.X* in the IDE

2.  Build and program the application using the IDE on to the **Target development kit**

    -   **LED1** will be turned-on to indicate that bootloader code is running on the target

    -   **LED1** will also turn on when the bootloader does not find a valid application; i.e. the first word of the application \(stack pointer\), contains 0xFFFFFFFF

3.  **If the test application is being programmed**, Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer and configure the serial port settings for **Target Development kit** as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

4.  Press the Switch **SW0** on the Host development kit to trigger programming of the application binary

5.  Once the programming is complete,

    -   **LED1** on the Host development kit will be turned on indicating success

    -   The target development kit will be reset. Upon re-start, the boot-loader will jump to the user application

    -   If the test application is programmed then **LED1** should start blinking and you should see below output on the **Target development kit** console

        ![output](GUID-486CF0C0-3906-436C-92FA-D7DEB8326B07-low.png)

6.  Press and hold the Switch **SW0** to trigger Bootloader from test application and you should see below output

    ![output](GUID-704DA7B6-9A5C-4D8A-A91F-09A3A105A851-low.png)

7.  Press Reset button on the Host development kit to reprogram the application binary

8.  Repeat Steps 4-5 once

    -   This step is to verify that bootloader is running after triggering bootloader from test application in Step 6


## Additional Steps \(Optional\)

### Using CAN NVM Host application

-   To bootload any application other than **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_e70\_xult.h** refer to [Application Configurations](GUID-DBAD37CB-BA5E-414D-A3EC-AA6555B345EA.md)

-   Once the application is configured, Refer to [Configuring NVM Host application project](GUID-1ED2F759-5E4D-46B1-A917-812D5232879E.md) for setting up the **host\_app\_nvm** project

-   Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)
