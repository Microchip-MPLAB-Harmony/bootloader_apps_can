## Setting up [SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro)

-   [SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsame54-xpro) is used for both **Host Development kit** and **Target Development kit**

    ![can_bootloader_host_target_connection](GUID-985E0786-75B2-4B99-8CD0-022FD5F5010F-low.png)

-   Connect the CANL on CAN Header of the **Host development kit** to the CANL on CAN Header of the **Target development kit**

-   Connect the CANH on CAN Header of the **Host development kit** to the CANH on CAN Header of the **Target development kit**

-   Connect a ground wire between the Host development kit and Target development kit

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the Host development kit to the computer using a micro USB cable

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the Target development kit to the computer using a micro USB cable


## Running the Application

1.  Open the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X* in the IDE

2.  Build and program the application using the IDE on to the **Target development kit**

    -   **LED0** will be turned-on to indicate that bootloader code is running on the target

    -   **LED0** will also turn on when the bootloader does not find a valid application; i.e. the first word of the application \(stack pointer\), contains 0xFFFFFFFF

3.  Open the NVM host application project *host\_app\_nvm/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X* in the IDE

4.  Build and program the NVM host application using the IDE on to the Host development kit

    -   The prebuilt combined bootloader and application HEX header file **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_e54\_xpro\_bootloader\_app\_merged.h** will be programmed to the **Target Development kit**

    -   This must be programmed once to program both bootloader and application into the inactive flash bank

5.  Open the Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer

6.  Configure the serial port settings for **Target Development kit** as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None

7.  Press the Switch **SW0** on the Host development kit to trigger programming of the binary

8.  Once the programming is complete,

    -   **LED0** on the **Host development kit** will be turned on indicating success

    -   **LED0** on the **Target development kit** should start blinking and you should see below output on the console

        -   The NVM Flash Bank Can be **BANK A** or **BANK B** based on from where the test application is running

    ![output](GUID-F424FED5-DABB-4A72-9900-E85B824FB8CF-low.png)

    ![output](GUID-7862A5A5-7B57-4B96-9DCD-5DC0A9103156-low.png)

9.  Press and hold the Switch **SW0** on the **Target development kit** to trigger Bootloader from test application

    -   This is to program the application binary in other bank and you should see below output

    ![output](GUID-71F31BD6-4029-41A4-AD7E-7C1AB62064AB-low.png)

10. To program the prebuilt application image **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_e54\_xpro.h** to the inactive bank of **Target Development kit**, Open the "user.h" file of the NVM host application project *host\_app\_nvm/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X* as shown below:

    ![btl_can_fail_safe_host_app_nvm_user_ide](GUID-E03F8D32-C4D5-4CEC-866C-2978A96E7981-low.png)

11. In the "user.h" file update the **APP\_HEX\_HEADER\_FILE** and **APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR** values as mentioned below

    ```
    #define APP_HEX_HEADER_FILE         "test_app_images/image_pattern_hex_sam_e54_xpro.h"
    
    #define APP_IMAGE_START_ADDR        0x82000UL
    ```

    ![btl_can_fail_safe_host_app_nvm_user_config](GUID-5CEB31A4-83D1-4710-9F3C-F96D774344B4-low.png)

    -   **APP\_HEX\_HEADER\_FILE:** Relative path to the generated header file containing the application hex image in an array

    -   **APP\_IMAGE\_START\_ADDR:** User application start address

        -   It must be set to **0x80000UL** when programming the **combined bootloader and application binary** to the inactive bank

        -   It must be set to **0x82000UL** when programming the **application binary** only to the inactive bank

12. Build and program the NVM host application using the IDE on to the **Host development kit**

13. On the **Target Development Kit** \(the board being programmed\), press and hold the Switch **SW0** and then press Reset button or Power cycle to force trigger bootloader at startup

    -   **LED0** will be turned-on to indicate that bootloader code is running on the target

14. Press Reset button on the **Host development kit** to program the application binary

15. Repeat Steps 7-8 once

    -   You should see other Bank in console displayed compared to first run


## Additional Steps \(Optional\)

### Generating Hex Image pattern for an application to be bootloaded

![bin_to_c_array](GUID-E53F2EF5-1C8B-4B68-BEF3-FF4835216ABA-low.png)

1.  To bootload any application other than **host\_app\_nvm/firmware/src/test\_app\_images/image\_pattern\_hex\_sam\_e54\_xpro.h** refer to [Application Configurations](GUID-DBAD37CB-BA5E-414D-A3EC-AA6555B345EA.md)

2.  Build the application project to generate the binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

3.  Convert the generated binary \(.bin file\) to a header file containing the image data in a C style array:

    -   On a Windows machine, open the command prompt and run the [btl\_bin\_to\_c\_array](GUID-AA3E00A3-26EF-40CA-8811-8E1D00F4C227.md) utility to generate a header file containing the image data in an array


```
python <harmony3_path>/bootloader/tools/btl_bin_to_c_array_gen.py -b <binary_file> -o <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_can/apps/can_fail_safe_bootloader/host_app_nvm/firmware/src/test_app_images/image_pattern_hex_sam_e54_xpro.h -d same5x
```

1.  Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)


### Generating Hex Image pattern for Commbined Bootloader and Application Binary

![can_bootloader_host_nvm_btl_app_merge](GUID-7981E68F-38A9-43F6-B556-B68EAFB2F9BE-low.png)

1.  Launch MCC for the bootloader project *bootloader/firmware/sam\_e54\_xpro.X*

2.  Select **system** component from the project graph and disable fuse settings

3.  **Disable Fuse Settings:**

    -   Fuse settings needs to be disabled for the bootloader which will be boot-loaded as the fuse settings are supposed to be programmed through programming tool

    -   Also the fuse settings are not programmable through firmware

    -   Enabling the fuse settings also increases the size of the binary when generated through the hex file

    ![btl_can_fail_safe_config_fuse_setting](GUID-5D724F3B-30E6-4C83-B093-FD03557FA0B0-low.png)

4.  Regenrate the project

5.  Specifing post build option to automatically generate the binary file from hex file once the build is complete

    ```
     ${MP_CC_DIR}/xc32-objcopy -I ihex -O binary ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.hex ${DISTDIR}/${PROJECTNAME}.${IMAGE_TYPE}.bin
    ```

    ![btl_can_fail_safe_post_build_script](GUID-6918F812-9618-486A-97F5-7D6B62E7243F-low.png)

6.  Build the bootloader project to generate the bootloader binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

7.  Build the sample application test\_app \(or any other application configured to bootload\) using IDE to generate the application binary **\(Do not program the binary\)**

8.  On a Windows machine, open the command prompt

9.  Run the [btl\_app\_merge\_bin.py](GUID-B7DA02C7-050A-4FA6-BDD6-7474C61C1083.md) utiliy from command prompt to merge the generated Bootloader binary and test application binary. Below output should be displayed on command prompt


```c
python <harmony3_path>/bootloader/tools/btl_app_merge_bin.py -o 0x2000 -b <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_can/apps/can_fail_safe_bootloader/bootloader/firmware/sam_e54_xpro.X/dist/sam_e54_xpro/production/sam_e54_xpro.X.production.bin -a <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_can/apps/can_fail_safe_bootloader/test_app/firmware/sam_e54_xpro.X/dist/sam_e54_xpro/production/sam_e54_xpro.X.production.bin
```

![btl_can_fail_safe_app_merger_console](GUID-3BC89637-3BC5-46B3-ACB9-AF91506ED20F-low.png)

1.  Run [btl\_bin\_to\_c\_array](GUID-AA3E00A3-26EF-40CA-8811-8E1D00F4C227.md) utility to convert the generated merged binary **btl\_app\_merged.bin** to a header file containing the image data in a C style array

    -   The merged binary will be created in the directory from where the script was called


```c
python <harmony3_path>/bootloader/tools/btl_bin_to_c_array.py -b <Path_to_merged_binary>/btl_app_merged.bin -o <harmony3_path>/bootloader_apps_can/apps/can_fail_safe_bootloader/host_app_nvm/firmware/src/test_app_images/image_pattern_hex_sam_e54_xpro_bootloader_app_merged.h -d same5x
```

1.  Once done repeat the applicable steps mentioned in [Running The Application](#running-the-application)
