### Path of the tool in bootloader repository is **tools/btl\_app\_merge\_bin.py**

## Setting up the Host PC

-   The Script is compatible with **Python 3.x** and higher


## Description

-   This script should be used to merge the bootloader binary and application binary

-   It creates a merged binary output where bootloader is placed from start and the application will be placed at the offset passed as parameter

-   If the application offset is not equal to end of bootloader offset it fills the gap with 0xFF until the application offset

-   The merged binary can be used by **CAN NVM Host Application** as input for Updating bootloader and application together

-   The merged binary will be created in the directory from where the script was called
